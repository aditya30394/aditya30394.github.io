As a Senior Software Engineer at Microsoft, I currently focus on the **Azure OpenAI Service**, building enterprise-grade AI solutions that bring together OpenAI's cutting-edge generative AI models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, ChatGPT) with Azure's robust security, compliance, and responsible AI features. I help create and refine solutions that enable businesses to harness large language models for text generation, code assistance, and transformative AI applications.

Previously, I contributed to **GitHub Codespaces**, building lightning-fast, cloud-based development environments. The same computing platform that underpins Codespaces now powers AI-driven experiences like **GitHub Copilot Workspace**, enabling developers to brainstorm, plan, build, test, and run code in natural language.

## Key Achievements

- Building scalable AI solutions on Azure OpenAI Service for enterprise customers
- Contributed to GitHub Codespaces infrastructure and performance optimization
- Significantly reduced infrastructure costs through efficient resource management
- Spearheaded migration of critical components to Basis infrastructure
- Mentored junior developers and fostered a culture of continuous learning
- Championed security enhancements and responsible AI practices
