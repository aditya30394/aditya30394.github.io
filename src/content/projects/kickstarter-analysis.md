In a world filled with brilliant entrepreneurs eager to make their ideas a reality, finding the funding necessary for such initiatives can be a challenging endeavor. Crowd-funding websites such as Kickstarter provide a way for savvy entrepreneurs to leverage the collective resources of the crowd to obtain the necessary capital to get their projects started.

## The Problem

While Kickstarter publishes many articles outlining best-practices for project creation, large scale analysis has shown that approximately **half of all campaigns still fail**. We believe that meaningful indicators exist that can predict whether a project is more likely to get successfully funded compared to others.

## Our Goal

By identifying these indicators, it is our goal to provide insights into what types of decisions project creators should focus their scarce time and resources on. We believe that project creators across all categories would benefit from these insights and that all good ideas deserve equal representation.

## Research Questions

Through group discussion and literature review, we determined 4 main questions to address:

1. **Sentiment Analysis**: Perform sentiment analysis on both the project 'blurb' and 'name' sections to determine if there is any relationship between predicted sentiment and the success or failure of the project

2. **Launch Timing**: Determine if there is a specific time of year when projects can be launched where they are more likely to be funded

3. **Goal Amount Impact**: Find out whether projects with "small" goal amounts are more likely to be successful compared to projects with "large" goal amounts

4. **Duration Impact**: Study the impact of various durations:
   - Time gap between project creation on Kickstarter and official launch date
   - Campaign length (difference between launch date and deadline)

## Impact

We feel that there are many ideas that exist in the world that, for one reason or another, do not have the financial resources or social visibility to be recognized by the public. It is our hope that by providing information to project creators about what features are most predictive of a successful campaign, all good ideas will be given equal representation and net social good will be promoted through the flourishing of novel innovations.

## Methodology

- Large-scale data analysis of Kickstarter campaigns
- Natural Language Processing for sentiment analysis
- Statistical modeling to identify success predictors
- Time-series analysis for launch timing patterns
- Comparative analysis across different funding goal ranges
