For making sense of the vast quantity of visual data generated by the rapid expansion of large-scale distributed multi-camera systems, automated person re-identification is essential. Person re-identification, a tool used in intelligent video surveillance, is the task of correctly identifying individuals across multiple images captured under varied scenarios from multiple cameras.

## Challenge

Solving this problem is inherently challenging because of issues posed by low-resolution images, illumination changes per image, unconstrained pose, and occlusions.

## Approach

In this project, we developed a Person re-identification model using Deep Neural Networks (DNN) which can handle variable size input images. Specifically, we implemented two preprocessing techniques to reduce overfitting:

- **Random Erasing:** A data augmentation technique to make our model robust to occlusion
- **Pose-normalized GAN:** Reduces the influence of pose variations on features

We also implemented and integrated Part-based Convolutional Baseline (PCB) to further improve results.

## Results

We evaluated our models on the Market1501 dataset and provided comprehensive validation and test results, demonstrating significant improvements in person re-identification accuracy.
